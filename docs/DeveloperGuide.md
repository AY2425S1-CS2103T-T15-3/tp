## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

Here is another example of interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("del_appt 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteAppointmentSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Planned Enhancements**

### `Last edited` functionality
Currently, there is no way to tell when a patient was last edited. This information might be crucial in a healthcare setting where the healthcare professional may need to know how recent the information is.<br>
**Planned implementation**<br>
We can make it such that a `Person` object contains a `LocalDateTime` field called `lastEdited` that keeps track of when the `Person` was last updated. This field will be updated whenever a new `Person` is created, be it from the `add` command or any of the other commands that edits a `Person`.

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

## **Appendix: Efforts**

This appendix provides an overview of the effort and complexity involved in modifying the original AB3 (Address Book Level 3) to create WardWatch. WardWatch extends AB3â€™s basic structure to support a healthcare-focused system, which manages multiple entity types and introduces new functionalities like handling patient information, medications, and appointments.

### Logic (Parser)
1. The Parser component required significant modifications to accommodate the new entity types and fields introduced in WardWatch. Challenges included:

    * **Tokenization**: Setting specific conditions for the tokenizer to handle new fields, such as medication and appointment, was complex. This required carefully configuring the tokenizer to recognize and differentiate between new input formats and ensure accurate data processing.
    * **Input Validation**: To handle healthcare-related data, validation had to be strict to avoid incorrect entries. This involved refining the Parser logic to enforce stricter data checks than AB3, requiring additional time to test and ensure robust error handling.

2. The FindCommandParser was challenging to implement as we wanted the command to be able to search different fields of patients, which meant that there were many different scenarios we had to account for. This increase in complexity made it harder for us to ensure that error inputs would fail graciously, as there were now more cases to consider.

### Logic (Command)
1. Creating new commands, especially the AddAppointment and AddMedication commands, presented unique challenges:
    * **Command Structure Adaptation**: Extending the existing command structure for WardWatch was necessary to support new types of commands without impacting AB3â€™s base functionality. This required carefully designing new command classes to integrate seamlessly with existing entities.
    * **Difficulty in Implementing AddAppointment**: The AddAppointment command was particularly challenging because it required understanding how to schedule and validate appointments within the existing architecture. This command also had to be compatible with patient data, ensuring appointments were correctly linked.

### Model
1. The Model component needed restructuring to support multiple entity types, such as patients, medications, and appointments, which added complexity:
   * **Data Relationships**: Establishing relationships between entities, such as linking patients with medications and appointments, was challenging. Designing these relationships in a way that allowed for seamless data manipulation without creating dependencies was an important aspect of the model redesign.

2. We had difficulty trying to implement a `SortedList` that was meant to keep track of the schedules that are meant to be shown, and returning them in a sorted manner. Challenges included:
   * **List type**: Although it might have been more intuitive to create a `FilteredList` of `Appointment` rather than `Person`, we require certain details about the patient. Hence, we had to make the list keep track of `Person` to ensure this functionality.
   * **Sorting a filtered list**: As we wanted to have the appointments be returned in order, we had to sort the list. However, we could not find a way to do this seamlessly, other than to create a `filteredList` and sort it from there. This could potentially be because of our lack of familiarity with `javaFX`.
   
### Storage
1. With the addition of the `Appointment` class, we had to learn how the JSON format worked, and how we could utilise its functionalities to allow for the successful storing and reading of data, now that every `Person` has an `Appointment` field.
2. It was necessary to get a basic understanding of how Json files work. Upon creating our new Json class that adapts to appointment, a weak understanding of @JsonCreator property caused initial bugs where appointment information had issues being retrieved from the Json file format. This bug was eventually fixed with greater understanding of Json.

### UI
1. UI Design required good understanding and identification of the relevant dependencies on the corresponding .fxml and .css files.
2. To restructure and customise the UI, a firm understanding of UI elements such as the HBox, VBox and Stackpanes is necessary to layout the UI elements according. There was particularly a struggle understanding the effects of the growing Hbox and Vbox, as the space occupied is unexpected.
3. Choice or colour to make the app aesthetic is also non-trivial
4. The setting of result boxes also required consideration, as too long or short may cause data to not be represented clearly, due to the text overflowing. It is also a tradeoff for space with the other elements
