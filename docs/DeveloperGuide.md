## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command. 
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`. 
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve. 
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here is another example of interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delappt 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteAppointmentSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

Using this 

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute the `delappt 1` command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a `DeleteCommandParser` and uses it to parse the command. 
2. This results in a `DeleteAppointmentCommand` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`. 
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete aa appointment from a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve. 
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Patient Feature

#### Overview
The `add` command allows users to add new patients. The command requires:
- **Name** â€“ Patient's name.
- **ID** â€“ Patient's unique ID.
- **Ward** â€“ Patient's Ward
- **Diagnosis** â€“ Patient's Diagnosis
- **Medication** - Patient's Medication

Here is an activity diagram that summarises the key steps taken.
<puml src="diagrams/AddActivityDiagram.puml" alt="AddActivityDiagram" />

#### 1. Parsing User Input
The **`AddCommandParser`** class is responsible for parsing user input. It uses `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the input string, extracting:
- **Name** â€“ Patient's name.
- **ID** â€“ Patient's unique ID.
- **Ward** â€“ Patient's Ward
- **Diagnosis** â€“ Patient's Diagnosis
- **Medication** - Patient's Medication

The parser will check that the compulsory `Name`, `ID`, and `Ward` fields are present, and that there are no duplicate parameters included in the input string. The optional `Diagnosis` and `Medication` fields will be parsed as empty strings if they are not included in the input string.

During this parsing process:
- A `Person` instance is created to hold the relevant fields.

#### 2. Executing the Command
The **`AddCommand`** class performs the following when adding a patient:

1. **Update Existing Patient Record**:  
   The new `Person` instance will be added to the existing patient record in the **Model**.

#### 3. Exceptions and warnings

The **`AddCommand`** class enforces validation rules to ensure non-duplicates and potential incorrect input fields.

- **Ensuring non-duplicates**:
  Check that the new person added does not already exist in WardWatch, i.e. does not already exist a person with same `ID`.

- **Warnings**
  The command will also check for the presence of *special characters* in the `Ward` and `ID` fields. An appropriate warning will be displayed if they are present.

### Add Appointment Feature

#### Overview
The `makeappt` command allows users to add an appointment tied to a specific patient. The command requires:
- **Index** â€“ Patient's index in the address book.
- **Start Date** â€“ Beginning date and time of the appointment.
- **End Date** â€“ Ending date and time of the appointment.
- **Description** â€“ Brief description of the appointment.

<puml src="diagrams/AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram" />

#### 1. Parsing User Input
The **`MakeAppointmentCommandParser`** class is responsible for parsing user input. It uses `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the input string, extracting:
- **Index** â€“ Identifies the patient in the address book.
- **Start Date** â€“ Beginning of the appointment.
- **End Date** â€“ End of the appointment.
- **Description** â€“ Additional details about the appointment.

During this parsing process:
- An `Appointment` instance is created to hold the appointment details.

#### 2. Executing the Command
The **`MakeAppointmentCommand`** class performs the following steps to add an appointment:

1. **Retrieve Patient Information**:  
   Uses the `index` from the parser to locate the patient in the address book.

2. **Create New Person Instance with Appointment**:
    - Combines patient information with the new `Appointment` details.
    - Creates an updated `Person` instance, including the appointment data.

3. **Replace Existing Patient Record**:
    - The new `Person` instance, containing the appointment, replaces the existing patient record in the **Model**.

#### 3. Handling Invalid Date Inputs
The **`MakeAppointmentCommandParser`** and **`MakeAppointmentCommand`** classes enforce validation rules to ensure correct date formats and scheduling logic:

- **Format Verification**:
    - **Parser** checks if the date format follows `dd-MM-yyyy-HH-mm`.
    - **Parser** also ensures the **Start Date** is before or equal to the **End Date**.

- **Conflict Checking**:
    - **Command** checks if the new appointment overlaps with any existing appointments for the patient.
    - If there is an overlap, an error message is thrown, preventing the appointment from being created.
    - If no overlap exists, the new appointment overrides any previous appointment.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Planned Enhancements**

### `Last edited` functionality
Currently, there is no way to tell when a patient was last edited. This information might be crucial in a healthcare setting where the healthcare professional may need to know how recent the information is.<br>
**Planned implementation**<br>
We can make it such that a `Person` object contains a `LocalDateTime` field called `lastEdited` that keeps track of when the `Person` was last updated. This field will be updated whenever a new `Person` is created, be it from the `add` command or any of the other commands that edits a `Person`.

# Appendix G: Effort

This section showcases the effort put into WardWatch by our team. We will highlight the difficulty level, challenges faced, and effort required in this project.

## Difficulty Level
WardWatch extends the Person entity originally implemented by AB3, incorporating new entities such as Appointment and Medication to cater to healthcare-specific needs. Adding these entities required us to consider new features, interactions between entities, and data storage, which proved to be more complex than initially anticipated.

Alongside modifying AB3â€™s existing features to better align with our target audience, WardWatch introduces many new commands to improve usability, especially in handling and tracking patient details and healthcare operations. Implementing these new features in a seamless and cohesive manner with existing functions required significant effort.

Although each team member contributed fewer lines of code than in individual projects, the group project demanded extensive coordination and communication. This collaboration was necessary to ensure features were integrated smoothly and consistently.

## Effort Required

### Enhancements to Existing Features

**Addition of New Fields to Patients**  
New fields such as diagnosis, medications, notes and appointments were added to align WardWatch with the requirements of a healthcare management application.

**Find Command Enhancements**  
Our team improved on the existing find command of AB3 to allow for greater flexibility. Users can now search for patients not only by name but also by other fields like diagnosis and medication. The enhanced command also enables users to filter patients based on specific criteria, which required us to redesign and test the search functionality thoroughly.

**Patient Tagging**  
We modified the original tag feature to automatically tag contacts in the WardWatch system. Patients with a unique ID are tagged as patients to streamline the management of patient data and make it easier for healthcare providers to organize contacts.

**User Interface (UI) Improvements**  
To enhance the user experience, we redesigned the interface to accommodate WardWatchâ€™s new features and match the healthcare theme. Additionally, we adapted the UI logic for easier modification by future developers.

### New Features

**Copy Command**  
Our team introduced a new copy command that allows users to copy contact information, such as patient email addresses, for mass communication purposes.

**Appointment and Medication Management**  
The appointment features were the most significant addition, requiring extensive restructuring of existing functions and introducing multiple new commands to manage and track appointments. This was the most complex feature and demanded the most effort, as it involved data synchronization across various entities.

## Challenges Faced

**Understanding AB3â€™s Codebase**  
One major challenge was understanding AB3â€™s existing codebase. Familiarizing ourselves with the structure, class interactions, and current features was necessary to identify potential areas of conflict when implementing new features. Integrating our modifications seamlessly into AB3 required extensive time and planning.

**Handling Data Interactions Between Entities**  
Creating interactions between new entities like Appointment, Medication, and the existing Person entity was complex. We needed a clear data structure to manage relationships between entities without causing dependencies that could hinder usability.

**Limited UI Space**  
Designing a user-friendly interface within the limited screen space presented a challenge. We had to make trade-offs between displaying sufficient information and keeping the interface simple to navigate. After much iteration, we finalized a layout that provides essential data without overwhelming the user.

**Appointment and Medication Implementation**  
Implementing appointments and medications turned out to be more complex than expected. These features required careful planning to handle different cases in a collaborative setting. Regular discussions were essential to distribute the workload efficiently and resolve conflicts promptly.

**Data Management**  
Managing data storage for appointments and medications presented additional challenges. We had to decide on an optimal structure to store patient-related data effectively. This required balancing between storing information in the main data entities versus distributing it across entities based on context.

**Bug Fixing and Testing**  
Debugging and testing were critical for ensuring a smooth user experience. While writing unit tests was straightforward, identifying edge cases proved difficult, especially for import/export functionalities. Thorough testing was crucial to ensure robust error handling and graceful application responses to unexpected inputs.

## Achievements
Overall, our team successfully implemented all planned features, addressed bugs, and managed potential feature conflicts. Despite initial challenges with implementing complex features like appointment and medication management, we overcame these obstacles through collaboration, achieving our project goals for WardWatch.
